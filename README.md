# hx711
A no-std rust library for the hx711 targeting the ESP32.

## Overview

The HX711 is a Load Cell Amplifier. "By connecting the amplifier to your microcontroller you will be able to read the changes in the resistance of the load cell, and with some calibration youâ€™ll be able to get very accurate weight measurements. This can be handy for creating your own industrial scale, process control or simple presence detection." 

This driver implements the requisite bit-banging described in this [datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/b/f/5/a/e/hx711F_EN.pdf?_gl=1*1yuadp6*_ga*MTY0Mzk3NTc1MS4xNjkxMzU4OTYx*_ga_T369JS7J9N*MTcwMjU4MzgzMC4xNi4wLjE3MDI1ODM4MzAuNjAuMC4w), and abstracts away the fine details to provide a generic `LoadCell` interface, with the ability to scale measurements (calibration) and offset measurements (tare).

This library makes extensive use of the `embedded-hal`, and the entire blocking approach is generic enough for any device supported by the `embedded-hal` (testing help greatly appreciated). The interrupt approach is currently implemented only for the esp32, making use of the `esp32-hal`.

## Installation

This crate is on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/loadcell), which means it can be installed by including this line in your `cargo.toml`:

```
loadcell = "0.3.0"
```

## Usage

The `/examples/` folder provides the key usage of the library.

The constructor takes ownership of the provided pins:

```
let mut load_sensor = hx711::HX711::new(hx711_sck, hx711_dt, delay);
```

Then this `load_sensor` object can be used like:
```
// zero the sensor
load_sensor.tare(16);
// set the sensitivity/scale
load_sensor.set_scale(1.0);

loop {
    if load_sensor.is_ready() {
        let reading = load_sensor.read_scaled();
        esp_println::println!("Last Reading = {:?}", reading);
    }
    delay.delay_ms(5u32);
}
```

### Calibration

The output of the loadcell is assumed to be a linear function mapping the raw measurements (`x`) to the output measurement (`y`). When the load cell is initialised, it has some offset (`c`). The device must be calibrated to determine the sensitivity (`m`), which can be done by applying the following formula:

```
y = mx + c
```

First, the offset (`c`) can be determined by "zeroing" the load cell. The `tare` function is used to do this, and calculates the offset automatically using `num_samples` samples.

Secondly, and this should be done for each individual load cell, the `m` value can be calculated by placing known masses on the scale. If you know the value of `y`, `x` and `c`, the value of `m` can be calculated by:

```
m = (y-c)/x
```

Personally, I start with `m = 1`, and adjust it until `y` matches the mass on the scale.
